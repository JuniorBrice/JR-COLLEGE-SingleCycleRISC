# JR-COLLEGE-SingleCycleRISC
Basic Single Cycle Datapath RISC Architecture and using I-type and R-type instructions. Written in System Verilog and implementable on an FPGA (would need to be modified 
to include some sort of display out like a 7 segment display).

Block Diagram of the RISC processor created, specifically highlighting a complete single datapath:

Successful simulation of the RISC processor:

Purpose/Objective:
The purpose of this was to test my understanding of the RISC-V architecture and to see if I can get a basic processor running in my spare time.

Capabilities:
Addition, substraction, loading, and storing. 

Areas for Improvement:
There are many typical instructions that are not present, such as multiplication, division, OR, AND, etc. Also, the whole system is somewhat barebones and limited in size.
There is also no way to verify functionality in the real world, since no display functionality was built into it.

Hope you find this interesting!
